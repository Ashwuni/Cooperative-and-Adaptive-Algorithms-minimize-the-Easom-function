# Cooperative-and-Adaptive-Algorithms-minimize-the-Easom-function

We want to minimize the Easom function of two variables x1 and x2.

a. Find a proper problem formulation, neighborhood function and cost function for this problem to apply SA
algorithm to solve it.

b. Report your observations on SA performance for solving this problem by:
    i. Selecting 10 different initial points randomly in [-100,100] → use the random function, do not
    generate yourself.
    ii. Selecting 10 different initial temperatures in a reasonable range → provide the range, justify your
    choice, and use the random function (use the best initial point that you found in i)
    iii. Selecting 9 different annealing schedules → 3 linear, 3 exponential, and 3 slow using different
    alpha values (use the best initial temperature from ii and best initial point from i)

c. What was the best solution you could find? What was the setting of SA to achieve that solution? Why was
that setting performing better than other settings
